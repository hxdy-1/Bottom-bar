## Features

- **Close-to-Reference Implementation**: Strives to closely resemble the [TimesTwo Design](https://timestwo.design/) website.

- **CSS modules**: Used CSS modules in React to scope the classes to components giving more control over them.

- **Vite & React**: Developed using Vite and React for modern development.

***I tried my best to make the bottom bar with animations as close the the reference as I could. Its not pixel perfect, but I hope its good enough to lend me the opportunity. Lastly I wanna thank Dimension-1 for considering my application.***
